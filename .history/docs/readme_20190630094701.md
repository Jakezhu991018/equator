title: Equator
---

Equator is the server for the client facing API for the Zion ecosystem.  It acts as the interface between [zion-core](http://zionc.info/developers/learn/zion-core) and applications that want to access the Zion network. It allows you to submit transactions to the network, check the status of accounts, subscribe to event streams, etc. See [an overview of the Zion ecosystem](http://zionc.info/developers/guides/) for more details.

You can interact directly with equator via curl or a web browser but SDF provides a [JavaScript SDK](http://zionc.info/developers/js-zion-sdk/learn/) for clients to use to interact with Equator.

SDF runs a instance of Equator that is connected to the test net [https://equator-testnet.zion.org/](https://equator-testnet.zion.org/).
